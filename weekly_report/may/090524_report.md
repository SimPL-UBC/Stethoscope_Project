## Progress

### Recording
I've recorded 2 trial run when I was sleeping.
Here are the images showing how the recording was taken.

### Dataset

Below are some datasets I found online that uses microphone or stethoscope as a recording device.
Some of them are annotated and verified by expert, and even used in research paper.
