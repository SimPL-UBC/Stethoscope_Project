# 17/05/24 Weekly Report

## Progress

### Machine Learning
I just tested some machine learning to get familiar with working with audio.
The main difference that I found vs working with image is the preprocessing part, everything else stays the same.
In audio, we convert audio file into a spectogram for training.

### Mold
Here are the mold made in onshape

Diaphgram mold

Base mold
```
I tried printing it using the lab printer yesterday and it failed. Tried the Bambu Lab printer on EDC yesterday, it failed this morning. I'll just tinker with the lab printer for the time being

### Recording Data
Recorded data again (ideal condition, sleep), but after talking a little bit with Ryan, looks like the sound isn't heartbeat.
Even if it is heartbeat, microphone did not pick up heartbeat constantly

### Importance of stethoscope
Well, from searching in the internet here is something I found:
- Can detect all 3 core organs: heart, lungs, and stomach/intestines
- It is a quick way to diagnose patient
- CT scans and MRI are expensive

### Next prototype?
I took some time to design next prototype. But so far they are more like a draft. 
The design should probably be more inline of the flat design that most paper used. If the mold doesn't work I will spend more time on designing pcb based microphone prototype

### Band Pass Comparison
I read carefully through all your code, but the most important one I feel is the `process_sleep_audio.m`.
We talked about this on Thursday, but here is a highlight of the code.\
```matlab
heart_beat = bandpassfilter(data_rec,Fs,2,20,150); %bandpass
```
From the definition of bandpassfilter function, it says that the code filter 20-150hz and is a 2nd order filter.
## Challenge

### Still no constant heartbeat
Even after a lot of testing, we still couldn't get constant heartbeat sound, even in ideal condition. The sound from stethoscope sounded distorted

### Filtering human voice
If we are making a 24/7 recording device, it would be beneficial to delete human conversation sound in the name of privacy.
I took a look at the internet for some inspiration, but this seems like a huge task to tackle.
The main problem is that human sound cover a huge frequency range. If we want to just delete the human sound, we need to detect when a human starts talking, and then apply a filter.

## Goals for Next Week

From now, I'm going to list a to-do list and see how much I can do.

- [x] Make the mold
- [ ] Test with new prototype
- [ ] Have a mini stethoscope design in mind
- [ ] Interview a doctor?
- [ ] Tidy up github page
